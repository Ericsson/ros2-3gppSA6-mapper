# Introduction

These set of ROS2 nodes explores the potential for making the use of 3GPP TS 23.434 SEAL (Service Enabler Architecture Layer) even easier and more automatic in various industry verticals applying ROS2 for their operation. The proposed solution involves implementing a mapping node that converts ROS2 settings to 3GPP SEAL requests, as well as an information collecting proxy node.

We cover three SEAL functionalities: 
-   group management
-   network resource management
-   network monitoring

We provide a solution that automatically maps ROS2 application layer information elements to SEAL requests, requiring the ROS2 application developer need only to tag the ROS2 topics for the special QoS handling. We demonstrate the feasibility and light-weight nature of their proposed solution.

The demo video of the proposed system in action can be seen at [https://youtu.be/JXGAHvDSU4o](https://youtu.be/JXGAHvDSU4o).
